# HP 8640 Rectifier board replacement

(Drop-in) replacement board for the A12 rectifier board in a HP 8640 signal generator.

## Rationale

The A12 rectifier board in my 8640B had seen siginificant heat after a faillure in the +/- 5.2V power boards.

After looking for correct replacement diodes, I figured it would probably be easier to create a replacement board.
